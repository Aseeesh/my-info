# Ashish Rijal's Portofolio

This is a repository of my portofolio page of using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) intended for personal use only. The site is forked from the incredible [Tailwind-Nextjs-Starter-Blog](https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog) by [Tim Lrx](https://github.com/timlrx). Check out [the parent repository documentation](https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog/blob/main/README.md) or fork this project to start building your own portofolio.
